>Description:
This is my first attempt to make a JavaScript game. This one is a typical pong game, where user has to bounce a ball off of movable paddle. Additionaly for every 5 points user has a change to catch a bonus ball that makes the paddle bigger. User wins the game when the paddle fills the whole width of canvas. In my project I used p5.js library.
